# Class level CRUD functions provide common support of CRUD operations
# as mixin for SqlAlchemy models.
# It saves boilerplate code for each model persistence implementation.
# There's a limitation: these class level CRUD functions don't provide
# instance reference of the model. An explicit session.get(Model, id)
# is needed to fetch the instance from the session.


class CrudMixin:

    # There is a big limitation of a class level list or get function:
    # the query can not be built with model specific ORM relationship.
    # Therefore, the query won't be able to support a custom eager fetch,
    # such as `select(..).where(..).options(joinedload(User.todos))`.

        # `Row` objects and instead receive ORM entities directly.

    # About synchronization strategy in ORM update:
    # `synchronize_session` chooses the strategy to update the attributes on
    # objects in the session.
    # In this case `fetch` indicates the list of affected primary keys should
    # be fetched either via a separate select statement or via `returning` if
    # the backend database supports it.
    # Objects locally present in memory will be updated in memory based on
    # these primary key identities. â€” from SQLAlchemy Documentation
